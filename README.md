EKAlgorithms
============

EKAlgorithms is a set of computer exercises implemented in Objective-C. 
Data structures, well known algorithms, CS curiosities, you name it!

Don't forget to *watch* the repository; Its content will be expanded and updated frequently.

Data Structures
---------------
1. Stack (LIFO).
2. Queue (FIFO).
3. Deque.
4. Linked list.
5. Graph 
    - DFS (depth-first search);
    - BFS (breadth-first search).
6. Binary search tree (BST).

Contributions
-------------   
Pull requests are welcome! But if you want to do a contribution, open an issue first.

Originally, the compiled exercises are for educational purposes only and have no intention of being the ultimate solution complexity-wise, but they do intend to be used by you as a starting point of a deeper study on algorithms and their optimization. 

Important Note
--------------
The Foundation framework already includes tools and methods for most of the exercises contained here. Kudos to Apple on that!
But... this. is. SPARTA!
So lets get our hands dirty and try to implement cool CS stuff with minimal use of existing APIs.

Thanks!
